            <h2>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>
            <p><i>"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"</i> is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 210 in the Perry Index. From it is derived the English idiom "to cry wolf", defined as "to give a false alarm" in <i>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i> and glossed by the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> as meaning to make false claims, with the result that subsequent true claims are disbelieved. The tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly tricks nearby villagers into thinking wolves are attacking his flock. When a wolf actually does appear and the boy again calls for help, the villagers believe that it is another false alarm and the sheep are eaten by the wolf.</p>

            <h2>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</h2>
            <p><i>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</i> is one of Aesop's Fables. In the original tale, a proud town mouse visits his cousin in the country. The country mouse offers the city mouse a meal of simple country cuisine, at which the visitor scoffs and invites the country mouse back to the city for a taste of the "fine life" and the two cousins dine like emperors. But their rich and delicious metropolitan feast is interrupted by a couple of dogs which force the rodent cousins to abandon their meal and scurry to safety. After this, the country mouse decides to return home, preferring security to opulence or, as the 13th-century preacher Odo of Cheriton phrased it, "I'd rather gnaw a bean than be gnawed by continual fear".  </p>
